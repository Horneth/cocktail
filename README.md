# 🍸 Cocktail

A fast, offline, install-to-your-phone cocktail recipe book. Open it, pick a
drink, and build it in seconds. Tweak measurements on the fly, keep personal
notes, and cross-link sub-recipes (syrups, cordials) shared across many drinks.

Built as a **PWA** — a web app you can "Add to Home Screen" that works fully
offline with all data stored locally on your device. No accounts, no server.

## Highlights

- **Instant, offline** — recipes live in IndexedDB and the app shell is cached
  by a service worker, so cold-open to recipe is sub-second and works with no
  network.
- **Build-it-now detail view** — a big serving stepper rescales the whole drink
  instantly; tap any single amount to nudge it. Amounts render as bar fractions
  (¾ oz) with an oz ⇄ ml toggle.
- **Non-destructive tweaks** — scaling and per-ingredient nudges never touch the
  stored recipe unless you tap *Save to recipe*.
- **Cross-linked sub-recipes** — a syrup is a first-class recipe. Tap through
  from a cocktail to its Simple Syrup and back; each component shows a
  *Used in* list of every drink that references it.
- **Parts & volumes** — recipes can be absolute (2 oz, ¾ oz) or ratio-based
  (1 part : 1 part), with a per-part volume selector.

## Stack

React + Vite + TypeScript · Dexie (IndexedDB) with `useLiveQuery` as the only
state layer · react-router · vite-plugin-pwa · CSS Modules. Deliberately few
dependencies.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173  (service worker enabled in dev)
npm run build      # production build + service worker
npm run preview    # serve the production build (test install/offline here)
npm test           # vitest — units, scaling, import/link dedup
npm run typecheck
```

## Data model (one entity, cross-linked)

A cocktail and a syrup are the **same** `Recipe`, distinguished by
`kind: 'cocktail' | 'component'`. Ingredients carry an optional `subRecipeId`
that points at a component; a denormalized `recipeLinks` table indexes that
relationship both ways (for fast *Used in* back-links and shared components).
See `src/db/schema.ts`.

## Roadmap: YouTube import (phase 2)

The seam is already in place. Every recipe — including the seed data — is
written through `importRecipe(StructuredImport)` (`src/import/importRecipe.ts`).
Adding YouTube import (e.g. the Anders Erickson channel, whose descriptions hold
the main cocktail plus labelled syrup blocks) is just implementing one pure
function, `parseRecipe(text) -> StructuredImport`, in
`src/import/parsers/andersErickson.ts`. It requires no schema change: the
`Recipe.source` provenance fields are already defined and optional.
